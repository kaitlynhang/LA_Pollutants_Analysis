# COVID-19 Air Quality Los Angeles Analysis

This project analyzes air quality trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data. Focusing on pollutants like NO₂, O₃, PM10, and PM2.5, it explores how lockdown-related changes in human activity impacted air pollution levels in Los Angeles and San Diego. The data was cleaned, visualized, and analyzed in Python to test hypotheses about pollutant behavior from 2013 to 2023, with a focus on the pandemic years.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
* Python (Pandas & NumPy) for data processing
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System (AQS) data API
